Typing Game

I made it using vanilla Javascript, css and html.

I used a youtube video on a similar typing game as inspo, but added my own stuff to it like the accuracy measurement
and timer that counts down to restart the game after a minute.

To run it just down load the files and click on "index.html".

Enjoy
